# Dashboard Design Analysis & Integration Guide

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the proposed new dashboard
design (based on the provided image and `admin_dashboard_layout_guide.html`) and
how it maps to the existing React-based dashboard implementation in the
`mafs-frontend` repository.

---

## 1. Design Overview (The "Vision")

The target design follows a structured **Zone-based Architecture (Zones A-E)**,
prioritizing AI-driven insights, critical system alerts, and specialized
behavioral metrics over generic KPI cards.

### Zone Breakdown

| Zone       | Component Name          | Key Purpose                                            | Visual Style                                         |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zone A** | **AI Morning Snapshot** | Natural language summary of current state.             | Full-width soft banner with custom icons.            |
| **Zone B** | **Ecosystem Alerts**    | Critical items requiring immediate human intervention. | "Traffic light" border indicators (Red/Amber/Green). |
| **Zone C** | **Health Metrics**      | Live performance indicators of the matching ecosystem. | Number cards with status "dots".                     |
| **Zone D** | **Core Analytics**      | User growth, revenue velocity, and live activity.      | Stacked bars, Donut charts, and a Scrolling Ticker.  |
| **Zone E** | **Behavioral Funnels**  | Conversion, engagement times, and success rates.       | Pyramid charts, Heatmaps, and progress-bar lists.    |

## 2. Existing Code Analysis

The current dashboard implementation is located in `src/modules/dashboard`. It
is functional but follows a "Standard KPI" pattern rather than the "Tailored
Insight" pattern seen in the design.

### Current File Structure

- **Main Page**:
  [Dashboard.jsx](file:///e:/WakeUpMonsterCodes/mafs-app/mafs-frontend/src/modules/dashboard/pages/Dashboard.jsx)
- **KPI Component**:
  [SectionCards.jsx](file:///e:/WakeUpMonsterCodes/mafs-app/mafs-frontend/src/components/shared/section-cards.jsx)
- **Charts**: Located in `src/components/shared/` (`chart-area-interactive`,
  `chart-user-distribution`, etc.)
- **Target Guide**:
  [admin_dashboard_layout_guide.html](file:///e:/WakeUpMonsterCodes/mafs-app/mafs-frontend/src/utils/admin_dashboard_layout_guide.html)
  (A static reference for the design).

## 3. Mapping Design to Code (The Implementation Gap)

To achieve the design in the image, we need to refactor or replace existing
components.

### ZONE A: AI Morning Snapshot

- **Design**: A narrative prompt like "Good morning! Revenue is up 12% today..."
- **Context**: Currently,
  [dashboard-insights.jsx](file:///e:/WakeUpMonsterCodes/mafs-app/mafs-frontend/src/components/shared/dashboard-insights.jsx)
  exists but handles generic data.
- **Proposed Change**: Implement a new component `AISnapshot.jsx` that takes
  processed KPI data and formats it into a natural language sentence.

### ZONE B: Ecosystem Alerts

- **Design**: Red/Amber cards for KYC Pending (45), High-report Users (12), etc.
- **Context**:
  [SectionCards.jsx](file:///e:/WakeUpMonsterCodes/mafs-app/mafs-frontend/src/components/shared/section-cards.jsx)
  already tracks "Open Reports" and "Pending Verifications".
- **Proposed Change**: Move these high-importance cards into a separate
  `EcosystemAlerts.jsx` row with the "traffic light" border styling defined in
  the guide.

### ZONE C: Health Metrics

- **Design**: Match liquidity (1.5%), Gender ratio (63:37), Revenue today
  ($84k).
- **Context**: These are the remaining cards from the current
  `SectionCards.jsx`.
- **Proposed Change**: Redesign `SectionCards.jsx` to use the more compact
  visual style from the guide, including the status dots.

### ZONE D: Analytics & Live Feed

- **Design**: Stacked Gender Bar, Donut Revenue, and a Live Activity Feed.
- **Context**: We have `ChartUserDistribution` and `RecentUsersTable`.
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Redesign `ChartUserDistribution` into a stacked horizontal/vertical bar for
    Male vs Female.
  - Create `RevenueDonut.jsx` for সাবস্ক্রিপশন vs Consumables.
  - Transform `RecentUsersTable` into a `LiveHeartbeat.jsx` scrolling ticker
    component.

### ZONE E: Behavioral Metrics

- **Design**: Conversion Pyramid, Swipe Heatmap, Success Bar List.
- **Context**: These components do not currently exist in the codebase.
- **Proposed Change**:
  - **Funnel**: Implement using `recharts` FunnelChart or a custom SVG pyramid.
  - **Heatmap**: Create a grid-based heatmap for peak usage hours.
  - **Success Metrics**: Simple vertical list with progress bars for ROI and
    Match Rates.

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations

> [!IMPORTANT] The HTML/CSS for the target design already exists in your
> `src/utils/admin_dashboard_layout_guide.html`. This serves as the CSS source
> of truth.

**Implementation Priority:**

1.  **Refactor Layout**: Update `Dashboard.jsx` to use a 3-column / tailored
    grid layout instead of the current stacked LG blocks.
2.  **Alerts & Health**: Split `SectionCards` into "Alerts" (Zone B) and
    "Health" (Zone C).
3.  **Live Heartbeat**: Convert the static user table into a dynamic feed.
4.  **Specialty Charts**: Build the Funnel and Heatmap components.
